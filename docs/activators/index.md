# Activators

## How to add an activator?
Each activator should provide a extension method to `IFeaturesFlippingBuilder` that register the requiring service(s) with the right option.

Available built-in activators are:
+ [Configuration based activators](configuration.md)
+ Entity Framework Core based activators
